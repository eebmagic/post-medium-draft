# Post Medium Draft

An Obsidian plugin that posts the currently open note to your Medium account as a draft.

## Setup

1. Create an integration token in your [Medium account settings](https://medium.com/me/settings).
    1. Go to `Security and apps`
    2. Then `Integration tokens` (at the bottom of the page)
    3. Choose a random name and generate the token
    4. Copy it to your clipboard
2. Install and enable the plugin
3. Go to the plugin settings
4. Paste the token generated earlier in the box for `Medium Service Integration Token`

## Posting Drafts
Once the plugin is setup then you can trigger a post in two ways:
1. **The ribbon icon** in the side bar (should be a monitor with an up arrow in it).
2. **The command pallete** (as `Post Medium Draft: Post to Medium as a draft`).

Once posted you should see a pop-up indicating the successful request.
You can then navigate to [your drafts list under your Medium account](https://medium.com/me/stories/drafts) where you will find the result of posting your note.


## Disclosures
**Network use:** This plugin makes `GET` and `POST` http requests to the [Medium API](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs) to get user info (to validate tokens) and to post drafts.
